# Declare "Bool" as a basic type and "True" and "False"
# as boolean constants:

Bool : *.

True : Bool.
False : Bool.

# Declare "List" as type constructor,
# so that "List Bool" is a type.
List : >**.

# Declare "Nil" as a constructor that given a type "a"
# returns a list of "a".
# For instance "Nil Bool" denotes the empty list of booleans.
Nil : :a*.List a.

# Declare "Cons" as a function that given a type "a", an
# element of type "a", and a list of "a" returns another
# list of "a". For instance "Cons Bool True (Nil Bool)"
# denotes the singleton list `[True]`.
Cons : :a*.>a>(List a)(List a).
